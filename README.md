Module: app
1.1 MainActivity

    Responsibility:
        Entry point of the application.
        Hosts the navigation graph and handles UI setup.

    Usage:
        Add MainActivity in the application manifest.
        Use MainActivity to launch the application.

1.2 MainViewModel

    Responsibility:
        Manages UI-related data and operations.
        Interacts with the WebSocketRepository to fetch and send messages.

    Usage:
        Use MainViewModel to observe and update UI-related data.
        Inject the ViewModel into the UI components using Hilt.

1.3 MainAPP.kt

    Responsibility:
        Application class.
        Initializes Hilt and other global components.

    Usage:
        Add MainAPP to the application manifest as the application class.

Module: data
2.1 WebSocketMessageDao

    Responsibility:
        Data Access Object (DAO) for WebSocket messages.
        Defines methods to interact with the local database.

    Usage:
        Use WebSocketMessageDao to perform CRUD operations on WebSocket messages.

2.2 AppDatabase

    Responsibility:
        Local database for storing WebSocket messages.
        Uses Room Database.

    Usage:
        Inject AppDatabase where local storage is required.

2.3 WebSocketRepositoryImpl

    Responsibility:
        Implements the WebSocketRepository interface.
        Manages data flow between the local database and the remote WebSocket server.

    Usage:
        Inject WebSocketRepositoryImpl into repositories and use cases.

Module: domain
3.1 WebSocketClient

    Responsibility:
        Handles WebSocket connection and communication.
        Provides methods for sending and receiving messages.

    Usage:
        Use WebSocketClient in the repository to establish and manage WebSocket connections.

3.2 WebSocketRepository

    Responsibility:
        Defines the contract for managing WebSocket messages.
        Acts as a bridge between the domain and data layers.

    Usage:
        Inject WebSocketRepository into use cases.

3.3 CacheMessagesUseCase

    Responsibility:
        Use case for caching WebSocket messages locally.

    Usage:
        Inject CacheMessagesUseCase where caching of messages is required.

3.4 CloseWebSocketConnection

    Responsibility:
        Use case for closing the WebSocket connection.

    Usage:
        Inject CloseWebSocketConnection where closing the WebSocket connection is required.

3.5 ReceiveCachedMessagesUseCase

    Responsibility:
        Use case for retrieving locally cached WebSocket messages.

    Usage:
        Inject ReceiveCachedMessagesUseCase where retrieving cached messages is required.

3.6 ReceiveMessagesUseCase

    Responsibility:
        Use case for receiving WebSocket messages from the server.

    Usage:
        Inject ReceiveMessagesUseCase where handling incoming messages is required.

3.7 SendMessageUseCase

    Responsibility:
        Use case for sending WebSocket messages to the server.

    Usage:
        Inject SendMessageUseCase where sending messages is required.

Module: di

    Responsibility:
        Contains Hilt-related configuration and dependency injection modules.

    Usage:
        Include the di module in the application module for Hilt setup.

Additional Notes
Testing

    All components should be unit-tested using appropriate testing frameworks.
    Use Coroutines Test for testing suspending functions and flows.

Coroutines Flow

    Utilize Coroutines Flow for handling asynchronous operations.

Hilt

    Utilize Hilt for dependency injection.

MVVM Architecture

    Ensure that the components follow the MVVM architectural pattern.

Multi-Module Architecture

    Modules should be structured logically, and dependencies between them should be well-defined.
