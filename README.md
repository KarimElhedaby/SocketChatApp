    Usage:
        Inject AppDatabase where local storage is required.

2.3 WebSocketRepositoryImpl

    Responsibility:
        Implements the WebSocketRepository interface.
        Manages data flow between the local database and the remote WebSocket server.

    Usage:
        Inject WebSocketRepositoryImpl into repositories and use cases.

3. Module: domain
3.1 WebSocketClient

    Responsibility:
        Handles WebSocket connection and communication.
        Provides methods for sending and receiving messages.

    Usage:
        Use WebSocketClient in the repository to establish and manage WebSocket connections.

3.2 WebSocketRepository

    Responsibility:
        Defines the contract for managing WebSocket messages.
        Acts as a bridge between the domain and data layers.

    Usage:
        Inject WebSocketRepository into use cases.

3.3 CacheMessagesUseCase

    Responsibility:
        Use case for caching WebSocket messages locally.

    Usage:
        Inject CacheMessagesUseCase where caching of messages is required.

3.4 CloseWebSocketConnection

    Responsibility:
        Use case for closing the WebSocket connection.

    Usage:
        Inject CloseWebSocketConnection where closing the WebSocket connection is required.

3.5 ReceiveCachedMessagesUseCase

    Responsibility:
        Use case for retrieving locally cached WebSocket messages.

    Usage:
        Inject ReceiveCachedMessagesUseCase where retrieving cached messages is required.

3.6 ReceiveMessagesUseCase

    Responsibility:
        Use case for receiving WebSocket messages from the server.

    Usage:
        Inject ReceiveMessagesUseCase where handling incoming messages is required.

3.7 SendMessageUseCase

    Responsibility:
        Use case for sending WebSocket messages to the server.

    Usage:
        Inject SendMessageUseCase where sending messages is required.

4. Module: di

    Responsibility:
        Contains Hilt-related configuration and dependency injection modules.

    Usage:
        Include the di module in the application module for Hilt setup.

Additional Notes:

    Testing:
        All components should be unit-tested using appropriate testing frameworks.
        Use Coroutines Test for testing suspending functions and flows.

    Coroutines Flow:
        Utilize Coroutines Flow for handling asynchronous operations.

    Hilt:
        Utilize Hilt for dependency injection.

    MVVM Architecture:
        Ensure that the components follow the MVVM architectural pattern.

    Multi-Module Architecture:
        Modules should be structured logically, and dependencies between them should be well-defined.

This documentation template provides a starting point for describing each component in your Android project. Adjust it as needed based on your project's specific requirements and conventions.
